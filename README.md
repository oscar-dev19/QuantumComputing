# 🧬 Quantum Computing Projects

Welcome to my Quantum Computing Projects Repository! 🎉

## About Me

Hey there! 👋 My name is Oscar Lopez. I'm a Python specialist and a current student at CSUSM working towards my Bachelor's in Computer Science. 🧑‍💻

I'm also a trainee and contributor to the U.S. Department of Energy's Renew Program, where we're exploring the cutting-edge world of quantum computing to discover alternative renewable energy sources. 🌱🔋

While I’m fairly new to this exciting field, and sometimes it feels like I might be biting off more than I can chew 🍽️, I'm incredibly enthusiastic about learning and contributing as much as I can! 🚀

## What You'll Find Here

In this repository, you'll discover various projects related to quantum computing. These projects may range from simple experiments to more complex research, all aimed at expanding my understanding and hopefully contributing to the field of renewable energy. ⚛️🔬
